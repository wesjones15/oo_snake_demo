# oo_snake_demo

## TODO
* fix file hierarchy
* refactor game.snake-specific segment to be pointer rather than arraylist
* rethink overall design
    * should the game.snake be separate from game.snake behavior
    * should segment collision be handled externally?
    * should segment be an interface or abstract class?
